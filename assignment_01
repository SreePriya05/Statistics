1. What exactly is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?
      Ans : Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and organizing data to describe its main features through measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. It focuses on presenting data in a meaningful way without making conclusions beyond the data. In contrast, inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions or inferences about a larger population. This involves hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis to draw conclusions and make decisions based on the data.
2. I'm not sure what is the difference between a sample and a population?
      Ans: A population includes all members or items of interest in a study, representing the entire group that a researcher wants to draw conclusions about. A sample, on the other hand, is a subset of the population, selected to represent the population in a study. Using a sample is often more practical and cost-effective than studying the whole population, and it allows researchers to make inferences about the population based on the sample data.
3. What distinguishes descriptive statistics from other types of statistics?
      Ans : Descriptive statistics are used solely for summarizing and describing the features of a dataset, providing a snapshot of the data's characteristics without making any predictions or inferences. Other types of statistics, such as inferential statistics, go further by analyzing sample data to make generalizations or predictions about a population. Descriptive statistics provide the groundwork for more advanced statistical analysis by giving a clear picture of the data at hand.
4. What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative data?
      Ans : Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured and counted, such as height, weight, temperature, or income. It allows for mathematical operations and statistical analysis. Qualitative data, on the other hand, is non-numerical and describes characteristics or qualities, such as colors, names, labels, or opinions. It is often used to categorize or describe attributes and is analyzed using methods like thematic analysis or coding.
5. What is the definition of a percentile?
      Ans : A percentile is a measure used in statistics to indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations in a dataset falls. For example, the 25th percentile (also known as the first quartile) is the value below which 25% of the data points are found. Percentiles are useful for understanding the relative standing of a value within a dataset and are often used in educational testing and health assessments to compare individual scores to a broader population.
